# G02 — Two-sided printed highlight stencil

Completed **2026-11-10T05:25:28.009Z**. Outcome: **inconclusive-source-or-detector-coverage**.

0 complete readings; all 40 selection scopes contained uncertain boundary words. No complete stencil decoding was justified. The hypothesis remains open.

Registered before target execution in commit [`90ad1d694b0eb236494ae199b87de05db5e3d331`](https://github.com/dctrpr/key-not-found/commit/90ad1d694b0eb236494ae199b87de05db5e3d331). [Fixed protocol](../GEOMETRY_PROTOCOL.json), [machine result](RESULT.json), [exact procedure details](DETAILS.json).

## Scope and limitations

No validated literal key excludes only the declared word-center truth tables with complete geometry.

- Uses corrected physical pairs and actual printed masks, not old chosen-p76 phrase boxes.
- Ambiguous target geometry/color is preserved and prevents a complete negative for affected readings.

All applicable synthetic controls passed. No network request, wallet import or transaction occurred. Inconclusive source coverage is not counted as a ruled-out cipher.

## Reproduce

From the research archive root, with Python, Pillow, NumPy and PyMuPDF (G06–G08 also macOS/Swift/Vision), use a fresh output directory:

```sh
PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1 python3 scripts/batch20_geometry.py --run G02 --protocol analysis_outputs/continuation_20261110/batch20/GEOMETRY_PROTOCOL.json --registration-commit 90ad1d694b0eb236494ae199b87de05db5e3d331 --out G02-rerun
```

[Saved streams](STREAMS.json) and [independent count/checksum audit](INDEPENDENT_CHECK.json) allow inspection. That audit checks saved outputs; it does not independently regenerate the image selector or detector.
